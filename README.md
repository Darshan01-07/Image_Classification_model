# Image_Classification_model
This is my first experimental model to classify any group of images which have to be already trained to the model.This is a basic classification model which gives accuracy upto 99.255013%.


*What is a classification model?
->A classification model is a type of machine learning model that is used to predict the class or category of an input data point based on its features. In other words, a classification model takes a set of input data and attempts to assign it to one of several predetermined classes or categories.

Classification models are typically trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a known class label. During training, the model learns to identify patterns in the features of the input data that are associated with each class label. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

Some common types of classification models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks. These models differ in their underlying algorithms, complexity, and performance on different types of datasets. The choice of classification model will depend on the specific problem and data at hand.
